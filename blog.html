	<h6> 9/20: A big performance from Harry Kane this week. He linked up with Son 4 times! And then got a goal of his own on top of that. Already one of the best performances this season. Lets see Harvey Elliott do that!</h6>
	<h6>Current thoughts: Manchester United need a pacey CB to link up with MaGuire</h6>
	<h6> 9/27: Harry Kane adds another to his assist totals with a beatiful feed for Lucas Moura. This feed wouldve been enough for the 3 points if not for the ridiculous penalty call in the 97th minute, also fuck Harvey Elliott</h6>
	<h6>Current thoughts: Manchester United still need a pacey CB to link up with MaGuire, also change the handball rules</h6>
	<h6>1/25: Harry has continued his fantastic year, with 12 goals and 11 assists in 18 appearances. Fantastic numbers. Unfortunately Spurs' results have been faltering recently, choking leads every game. </h6>
	<h6>Dear Harry, I dm'd, but you still ain't callin'. I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom.I sent two dm's back in autumn, you must not've got 'em. There probably was a problem with internet or somethin'. Sometimes I scribble usernames too sloppy when I type 'em</h6>
